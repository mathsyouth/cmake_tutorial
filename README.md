# CMake Tutorial

Clone [github source code](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/tree/master/Help/guide/tutorial) of [CMake official Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html).

## Introduction

The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers common build
system issues that CMake helps address. Seeing how various topics all
work together in an example project can be very helpful.

## Steps

The tutorial documentation and source code for examples can be found in the `Help/guide/tutorial` directory of the CMake source code tree.  Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step provides the complete solution for the previous step.
